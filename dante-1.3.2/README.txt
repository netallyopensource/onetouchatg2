Dante is a circuit-level SOCKS client/server that can be used to provide convenient and secure network connectivity, requiring only the host Dante runs on to have external network connectivity. Once installed, Dante can in most cases be made transparent to clients while offering detailed access control and logging facilities to server administrators.

Developed by Inferno Nettverk A/S, Dante is released under a BSD/CMU-type license and comes with complete source code.

Dante is used daily by Fortune 100 companies and large international organizations, either as a standard SOCKS server or as a "reverse proxy".

Inferno Nettverk A/S provides various commercial services related to Dante, including support, customized installations/tuning, development, porting and embedding. For more information about commercial support, see the Dante support page.

Configuration and setup of Dante is described in the configuration pages.

Several commercial modules are available for the Dante server. For more information see the module page.
